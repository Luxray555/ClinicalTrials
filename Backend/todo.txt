    --------------------------------------- todo list 1st March 2025 ---------------------------------------
    * Learn pupeteer :done
    * integrate Unicancer :done
    * Finish the autoMapper ( make it read the content of the field also so he can know where to put the data .)
    * Build statistics for the Website


    * Addresses Missing: In the participating centers section, the address fields are empty, even though other center details are captured. This might be worth investigating.
    * Empty Inclusion Criteria: All examples have empty inclusion criteria arrays while having exclusion criteria. This suggests there might be an issue with the selector for inclusion criteria.
    * Evaluation Criteria: The evaluation criteria field is empty in all examples, which is consistent but might indicate this field isn't being properly extracted.
    * Objects in JSON Output: In some coordinates fields, there's [Object] instead of the actual values (this might just be a console.log limitation rather than an issue with your code).
